# Example configuration file for using the OpenGrid code through the docker container.
# Rename this file to opengrid.cfg but do not commit it in order not to mess-up 
# other developers config files.

# You need a configuration file in the opengrid library
# directory, in the 'current' directory and/or pass it to the 
# constructor of the Config class. The latter always takes
# precedence over the former.
